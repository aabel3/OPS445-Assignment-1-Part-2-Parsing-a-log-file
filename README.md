# OPS445 Assignment 1 – Part 2

Welcome to OPS445 Assignment 1 – Part 2!

In this assignment, you will continue building on your Python programming skills by focusing on modularity, error handling, and structured program design. You’ll expand your work from Part 1 into more complex, reusable components that demonstrate professional coding practices.

📚 Assignment Objectives:
Reinforce the use of functions with arguments and return values
Organize code into modules and import them effectively
Apply loops and conditionals in larger, structured programs
Strengthen exception handling to make programs more robust
Work with files and system commands to integrate Python with Linux environments
Document your work with clear outputs and logs for grading

📂 Assignment Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this assignment:
a1p2.py – Main assignment script
Supporting function modules (e.g., functions.py)
Test scripts for validating modular functionality

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
Keep functions small, focused, and reusable.
Use try/except blocks to handle errors gracefully.
Test modules independently before integrating them into the main program.
Compare Python’s modular design with Bash scripting to understand differences in structure.
Keep your code well-commented and organized for easier debugging and grading.
